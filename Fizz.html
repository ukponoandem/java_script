The formula for calculating Fizz Buzz involves checking divisibility by 3 and 5. Here's the formula:

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
If none of the above conditions are met, print the number itself.
